# YouTubeTranscriptSummarizer

**A Python-based tool designed to extract and summarize transcripts from YouTube videos.**

## Overview

YouTubeTranscriptSummarizer is a Python-based tool designed to extract and summarize transcripts from YouTube videos. This project simplifies the process of understanding long-form video content by generating concise summaries from the video's spoken content.

## Features

* **Transcript Extraction:** Automatically fetches video transcripts using YouTubeTranscriptAPI.
* **Natural Language Processing:** Leverages spaCy to process and analyze text.
* **Summarization:** Uses frequency-based text summarization techniques to extract key points from the transcript.
* **Customizable Input:** Works with any YouTube video that supports captioning.

## How It Works

**Video ID Extraction:**

The pytube library extracts the video ID from the YouTube URL.

**Transcript Retrieval:**

YouTubeTranscriptAPI fetches the transcript of the video in text format.

**Text Preprocessing:**

* Tokenizes the transcript using spaCy.
* Removes stop words and punctuation.

**Word Frequency Calculation:**

* Assigns weights to words based on their frequency, excluding common stop words.

**Summary Generation:**

* Uses a frequency-based approach to extract the most relevant sentences from the transcript.

## Example

**For a YouTube video with a transcript, the output might look like this:**

**Input:**

YouTube URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example_video_id

**Output:**

Full Transcript:
"This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence..."
Summary:
"This is the key takeaway of the video."

## Future Enhancements

* Add support for videos in multiple languages.
* Integrate advanced NLP models like BERT for improved summarization.
* Develop a web-based interface for easier interaction.
